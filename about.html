      <p> The Commission was created by the Board of Chosen Freeholders by resolution according to State Statute on January 1, 1971. Its responsibilities include the "development of programs to promote interest and participation in and understanding of local history, arts, cultural values and goals of the community and state by working directly with arts and historical organizations, schools, religious organizations, service clubs, municipal governments and other interested groups and individuals." The Commission may establish museum and cultural programs, including fine and performing arts programs; undertake historical, architectural, and genealogical research; and publish reports, directories, and books that help develop interest in historical and cultural matters. Programs are designed to serve residents of all ages. </p>

        <a href = "http://www.co.hunterdon.nj.us/depts/c&h/memberbios.htm"> Nine Commissioners </a> are appointed by the Freeholders; each serves a five-year term without compensation and may be reappointed. Efforts are focused on creating a Commission that is culturally diverse and geographically representative, with expertise in the arts or history.
